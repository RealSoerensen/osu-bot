# osu!bot

osu!bot can automatic detect the circles and approach circle with AI. It will click when the radius of the 2 circles is within 5 pixels.

## Installation

Run the "setup.bat"-file to install the neccessary libraries.

## Usage

First open osu! and change your display mode to fullscreen windowed and disable raw input.

Then run the "main.py"-script.

## Caution

If your mouse is out of control use CTRL+ALT+DEL to stop it

## CURRENTLY NOT WORKING

The script currently doesnt work as the cursor is blocked from moving when in game.
It could move when I started developing it but now it doesn't for some reason.
The script will most likely remain like this.
